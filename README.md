## State Transition Commitment Engine
### Overview
The **State Transition Commitment Engine** is an off-chain token transaction framework designed to manage, store, and transfer tokens outside of the blockchain ledger. This can occur on users' premises or in the cloud, ensuring that only **state transition commitments** are generated on-chain.

### Token as a Stand-Alone Entity
Each token functions as a self-contained entity, holding all necessary information and cryptographic proofs attesting to its current state, including:
- **Ownership**
- **Value**
- **Other cryptographic attributes**

### State Transition & Blockchain Interaction
When a token's state changes, the system consults the **Unicity blockchain infrastructure** to produce a **state transition commitment**. This commitment serves as a cryptographic proof that:
1. The token has transitioned from a verifiable source state to a newly defined state.
2. No other transitions occurred from the source state before this one.

### Privacy & Security
The cryptographic commitments regarding token spending are **privacy-preserving** and do **not** reveal:
- Information about the token itself.
- Its initial or destination state.
- The nature of the transaction.
As a result, even if someone observes network traffic between clients and the Unicity infrastructure, they cannot determine whether the submitted commitments pertain to token transactions or unrelated processes.

### Scalability & Efficiency
All transaction commitments are aggregated into a **global distributed hash tree** structure, rooted in the Unicity blockchain. This approach enables:
- **Horizontal scalability** of the blockchain infrastructure.
- **On-demand processing** of transaction commitments.
- The ability to accommodate **millions of transaction commitments per block**.

## Web GUI interface
[Token GUI stand-alone page](https://unicitynetwork.github.io/tx-flow-engine/)
### Mint token:
 - Set the password to lock up the token to be minted (central panel, field `Secret`)
 - Set the token type (or leave default `unicity_test_coin`) in he field under button `New`, right pannel
 - Set the token value (or leave default 1000000000000000000) in the field below token type below button `New`, right pannel
 - Push button `New` and wait few seconds for getting the state transition commitment from the Unicity gateway "https://gateway-test1.unicity.network:443". The central text field will be populated with the JSON document containing the token and the left pannel will get the token info extracted from the JSON document. You can push button `Check` in the left pannel to check current token status for the given token and given password ('Secret' field)

### Recipient pointer:
A recipient must generate the pointer to which the token ownership must be changed.
 - Set the password to lock up the token expected to be received (central panel, field `Secret`)
 - Push `Generate Pointer/Nonce` button. Share the pointer with the sender, keep the Nonce in order to "import" the token when received

### Send token:
 - Set the password to unlock the token for sending (central panel, field `Secret`)
 - Set the pointer obtained from the recipient in the field below `Send` button, right field
 - Push `Send` button
 - When the JSON document gets updated in few seconds after "talking" to the unicity gateway (check that the `transaction` field is non-empty), copy the JSON document and send it with whichever means to the recipient (a messenger, email, flash drive, etc.)

### Receive token:
When the recipient gets the JSON document containing the token, the transaction field in the document must be resolved into the transition, the ownership info gets updated and locked to the recipient password
 - Set the password to lock up the token received (central panel, field `Secret`)
 - Set the `Nonce` into the field below the `Import` button, right panel
 - Push `Import` button, wait till the token status on the left panel gets updated to "Spendable" in few seconds
 - Congrats! You have successfuly received the token! Do not forget to save the JSON document for future use (local disk, cloud, etc.). It is safe to store the token locked by the password on a public media, though not good for the confidentiality.

## Setup instructions
 - Fetch the project: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/unicitynetwork/tx-flow-engine.git`
 - Make sure to have npm and node installed
 - go to `tx-flow-engine` project folder
 - run `npm install`
 - go to `aggregators_net` subfolder
 - run `npm install`

## Usage
 - use `state_machine.js` and `helper.js` for SDK
 - use `token_manager.js` as generic CLI tool
 - use bash scripts in `./cli` folder to mint, transfer and receive tokens stored in TXF files as JSON object

## Token
Token is an entity holding value and optionally some other application-specific data. Token is mined by a client within client's premises with the cryptographic proofs stating the valid reasons why the token could be mined. In a simple example, it is enough to
demonstrate the proof that a token with the given id has been mined just once. Token state represents encoding of the current owner as a challenge requesting to demonstrate knowledge of private key for the given public key (via digital signature).
Token state transition consists of a solution for the challenge encoded in the current state as well as new state (ownership) the token goes to. In ths manner, the token's current/latest state is demonstrated through a sequence of transitions from its genesis/minting
till the latest state. Each transition is supplied by a unicity proof generated by the Unicity infrastructure, proving that this was the only transition from its source state. Note, is is not possible to generate two transitions of the same token state 
with the unicity proofs.

In order to hide token's owner public key from the Unicity public infrastructure (and everyone else reading data streams to and from the Unicity) as well as from the previous token owner, the token state gets obfuscated with precalculated random nonce 
(hash of the recipient owner public key + noncem + some other data) and is shared with the sender as a pointer and with Unicity as the commitment id. It is done in such a way that it is not possible to learn from the pointer and from the commitment neither each 
other, nor the recipient's public key, nonce, token id and token class. Moreover, from the Unicity commitment alone, it is not possible to identify whether the commitment was generated for the token transition or for anything else.

As another measure to hide the owner's identity from observers, we enforce one-time use of public keys via calculation of the key pair based on the user's secret and one-time random nonce. In this manner, a user can access and send his/her/its tokens attached to 
seemingly different unrelated public keys.

### Token structure
 - tokenId: unique 256bit id of the token
 - tokenClass: unique 256bit code identifying the token class (for instance, unicity utility token, wrapped cryptocurrency or fiat token, some nft or app-specific utility token). An app developer is free to define the own token class with specific minting and transfer rules (by analogy with deploying own ERC20 or ERC721 contract).
 - tokenValue: numeric value of the token represented as big integer. One may follow same fraction denomination rules as in Ethereum framework (one monetary unit ca be devided at most into 10**18 atomic smallest monetary units)
 - Genesis: all minting-related proofs and data
 - transitions: sequence of state transitions from the genesis up to the latest state with all the necessary Unicity and other proofs
 - state: current token state containing public key, nonce, etc.

## Transition and transaction
A transition is a record defining what token state changes into what state, and proofs unlocking the challenge encoded in the source state, unicity proof and salt. Since a token sender does not know the recipient's state, but only the pointer, the sender cannot
create a valid transition. Hence, we say that the sender creates a `transaction`, a structure containing the source token state, the recipient's nonce and the salt. The salt is a random value needed to obfuscate the transaction digest so that any person with
the knowledge of the source state (sender's public key) and the recipient's pointer cannot guess from the Unicity commitment whether the token has been transfered to the given recipient or to someone/somewhere else. Only the recipient can resolve a transaction into the
relevant transition by substituting the pointer into the respective recipient's token state.

### Transaction structure
 - Source state: sender's public key, nonce, tokenId, tokenClass, etc.
 - Input: sender's proof of the ownership and Unicity state transition commitment
 - Destination pointer: the prointer refering the hidden expected token's destination state. Must be shared by the recipient with the sender
 - Salt: randomly generated value to obfuscate and make the transaction's digest unpredictable

### Transition structure
 - Source state: sender's public key, nonce, tokenId, tokenClass, etc.
 - Input: sender's proof of the ownership and Unicity state transition commitment
 - Destination state: sender's public key, nonce, tokenId, tokenClass, etc.
 - Salt: randomly generated value to obfuscate and make the transaction's digest unpredictable.

## State
Represents current token state. Encodes challenges needed to be solved in order to unlock the token. For instance, a challenge can be represneted by the owner's public key as the request to demonstrate the knowledge of the respective owner's private key.

## State structure
 - tokenId: unique 256bit id of the token
 - tokenClass: unique 256bit code identifying the token class (for instance, unicity utility token, wrapped cryptocurrency or fiat token, some nft or app-specific utility token). An app developer is free to define the own token class with specific minting and transfer rules (by analogy with deploying own ERC20 or ERC721 contract).
 - pubkey: the token owner's public key
 - nonce: randomly generated one-time use value (one time per public key-token pair)

## Unicity commit
In order to prove no double-spend of a token, when creating a token transaction, the user must submit the transaction commitment to the Unicity gateway, obtain the unicity proof/certificate for the commitment and include that into the transaction. The commitment
is a key-value pair, where the key is the commit requestId derived from the current token's state in such a way, that each unique state derive unique requestId and it is not possible to derive from the requestId the respective token state back. Clearly, since 
all tokens throughout all their life cycle will never incure same state, their requestIds will be unique. In this manner, if there is no double-spend intent, there will never be two different commits with the same requestId. Unicity cannot include and generate
certificates for two different commits with the same requestId. The value of the commit contains payload and the authenticator field. The payload is the digest of the transaction spending the given token state (since a transaction contains a random salt, the
payload cannot be predicted from the token source and destination pointer alone). The authenticator is needed for the commit's self-authentication. The authenticator contains the owner's public key, the payload signature and the obfuscated token state such that 
the requestId could be derived. This means, only the token owner should be able to register the transaction commit with the Unicity since no one else knows the owner's private key and cannot produce the valid authenticator corresponding to the requestId.

## Transaction flow
Structure containing token and optionally transaction data. Used for sharing and synchronizing the token state between the users.

## Tools
### SDK: state_machine.js, helper.js
It is a library of functions you can use to integrate you project with the transaction flow engine. You can use it to mint, send and receive tokens.
 - mint: creates a token structure, generates uniicity certificate for proving single mint for the given token id.
 - createTx: generates transaction structure and state transition commitment in Unicity certificate for the token, recipient's pointer, salt, sender's secret and transport object
 - exportFlow: used to export token and transaction as a JSON object flow
 - importFlow: used to import token and optionally transaction from the flow JSON object. If transaction is present, the recipient resolves it into the token state transition and derives the latest token state.
 - getTokenStatus: probes the current token state against the given user's secret (verifies the respective ownership) and spend proof (has the latest state been already spent, but not updated in the given token structure) via querieng the Unicity gateway
 - collectTokens: scans the set of given tokens and filters those unspent for the given user (derived from the user's secret)
 - helper.calculatePointer: derives pointer to be shared with the token sender. It is derived from tokenClass, secret and nonce

### CLI: token_manager.js
Command line tool for processing transaction flows and managing tokens. Uses state_machine.js and helper.js. Accepts input TX flow from stdin and outputs processed flow through stdout.
 - ./token_manager.js mint [options]: outputs tx flow with the newly minted token
 - ./token_manager.js pointer [options]: generates the recipient's pointer. Must be run by the recipient and the pointer to be shared with the sender. Note, keep the nonce in secret and do not share it!
 - ./token_manager.js send [options]: gets the token to be sent through the tx flow in stdin and outputs the tx flow with the transaction. Note, you must get the recipient's pointer first from the recipient
 - ./token_manager.js receive [options]: consumes TX flow with the token and transaction, resolves transaction into the transition, updates the token state and outputs the updated token as TX flow through stdout
 - ./token_manager.js summary [options]: from the stdin tx flows, filters unspent tokens owned by the user defined by his/her/its secret and outputs the summary (balance and owned tokens)

### CLI convenience tools
Scripts in ./cli. Manages TX flows stored in ./txf folder.

### Example flow:
#### On User1: Mint token to user1 with secret1: 
```bash
stf/cli$ ./mint.sh
